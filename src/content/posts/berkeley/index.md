  George Berkeley was an Anglo-Irish philosopher who is regarded as the founder of "immaterialism". As a leading
  empiricism, he had a profound influence on the views of other thinkers, especially Immanuel Kant and David Hume.
  Berkeley argued against Isaac Newton's doctrine of absolute space, time and motion in De Motu. His arguments were a
  notable precursor to those of Ernst Mach and Albert Einstein. Interest in Berkeley's ideas and works increased greatly
  after World War II because they tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century,
  such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of
  language

Philosophy of Berkeley
----------------------

George Berkeley (1685–1753) was an Anglo-Irish philosopher and Anglican bishop who is best known for his radical
philosophical position of __immaterialism__, also known as __subjective idealism__. His most famous dictum,
"Esse est percipi" (to be is to be perceived), encapsulates the core of his thought. Specifically:

- __Rejection of Material Substance:__ Berkeley fundamentally denied the existence of matter, or mind-independent
  material substance. He argued that there is no "stuff" or substratum that exists independently of a perceiving mind.
- __Reality as Ideas:__ For Berkeley, everything that exists is either a mind (a "spirit") or an "idea" in a mind.
  Physical objects, such as trees, houses, or tables, are not external material things but rather collections of ideas
  or sensations perceived by a mind.
- __Direct Perception:__ We do not perceive an external material world that _causes_ our ideas. Instead, we directly
  perceive ideas. When you see a red apple, the redness, the shape, the taste, the smell - these are all ideas in our
  mind. There is no underlying material "apple" that exists apart from these perceived qualities.

If "to be is to be perceived," what happens to objects when no human mind is perceiving them (e.g., a tree in an
uninhabited forest)? Berkeley's answer is that __God, as an infinite and omnipresent mind, perceives everything
continuously__. This divine perception ensures the consistent and orderly existence of the world, even when individual
finite minds are not attending to it. God, according to Berkeley, is also the ultimate source of our sensory ideas. The
regularities and patterns we observe in nature are a result of God's consistent will and the orderly way in which the
God impresses ideas upon our minds.

Berkeley's ideas had a significant impact on subsequent philosophers, particularly David Hume, who pushed empiricism to
its skeptical limits, and later idealists like __Immanuel Kant__ and __German Idealists__. While often criticized for
its counter-intuitive nature, Berkeley's work _forced_ philosophers to seriously consider the nature of perception,
reality, and the relationship between mind and world.

[Berkeley also engaged with the science of his day](#berkeley-on-mathematics), arguing that scientific laws describe the
regularities among our ideas, not inherent properties of a material world. He viewed causation not as one material
object "making" another happen, but as a consistent sequence of ideas, ordained by God.

Berkeley on Mathematics
-----------------------

Of all treatises written on the subject in the eighteenth century, Berkeley's
[_Analyst_][The Works Of George Berkeley Vol. 3] was the most sustained and penetrating critique of the methodology of
the infinitesimal calculus. This work foreshadows the foundational research of the nineteenth century, and provides a
link between the mathematical preoccupations of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and those of the nineteenth.

Broadly speaking, the mathematicians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries - and in particular Newton, Leibniz,
and Euler - had been more concerned with exploiting and extending the techniques of the differential and integral
calculus than with tidying its foundations. The mathematicians of the early nineteenth century, in contrast, bent their
efforts towards placing the calculus on an unobjectionable footing - towards chasing away the obscurities that
surrounded such notions as _infinitesimal_, _limit_, and _differential_. This project was pursued during the first
two-thirds of the nineteenth century by such mathematicians as Gauss, Bolzano, Cauchy, Abel, Fourier, Riemann, and
Weierstrass. Their investigations into the foundations of real analysis in turn inspired the later studies by Dedekind,
Cantor, Frege, Peano, Peirce, Russell, and Hilbert of set-theory, logic, and the foundations of arithmetic.

Berkeley's [_Analyst_][The Works Of George Berkeley Vol. 3] prefigures this entire development, and his
philosophically-motivated criticisms of the Newtonian mathematics of the eighteenth century raise many issues that will
loom large in the selections that follow. These issues may be loosely grouped under 4 headings.

1. His critique of _infinitesimals_ raises not only the issue of justifying the central concepts of the calculus but 
   also the more general issue of the legitimacy of the _actual infinite_ in mathematics
2. Berkeley, as befits the empiricist philosopher who wrote _An essay towards a new theory of vision_, makes acute
   comments about the relationship between geometry, human visual perception, and the foundations of the calculus.
3. In numerous places Berkeley discusses the problem of the _reference_ of mathematical expressions; declaring, for
   instance, in _Of infinites_, that "This plain to me we ought to use no sign without an idea answering to it"; __one
   of his cardinal criticisms of Newton is that infinitesimals can have no empirical reference__. This topic of the
   reference of mathematical expressions (a topic on which Berkeley occasionally shifted his position) was to be central
   to the development of algebra during the nineteenth century
4. All these mathematical issues - in analysis, geometry, and algebra - are intertwined in Berkeley's thought with more
   general concerns about mathematical truth, the rigour of demonstrations, the applicability of mathematics to the
   empirical world, and the scope and limits of mathematical knowledge. Philosophers more often react to developments in
   mathematics than anticipate them, and in modern times perhaps only Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant can be said to have
   equalled Berkeley's insight into the foundations of mathematics .

The connection between Berkeley's mathematical interests and the leading strands of his philosophy was not adventitious:
his education at Trinity College, Dublin was in mathematics and logic as well as in philosophy and the classics, and the
foundations of mathematics was to be a lifelong preoccupation. His investigations into the philosophy of mathematics
commenced with his first published work (in effect, his bachelor's thesis), the _Arithmetica et miscellanea
mathematica_; they were continued in his early, unpublished Philosophical commentaries and _Of infinites_ - especially
in _Notebook B of the Commentaries_, where remarks on optics and on the nature of the soul mingle with observations on
algebra, geometry, and the infinitesimal calculus; they play a major though subsidiary role in his _Principles of human
knowledge_, _De motu_, and _Alciphron_; and they are once more the centre of attention in his last major philosophical
enterprise, the critique of Newton and the Newtonians in _The analyst_.

__Berkeley's writings show the futility of attempting to draw a sharp boundary between philosophy and mathematics__. We
have already observed that his philosophical reflections led him to deep criticisms of current mathematical practice.
But the influence goes in the other direction as well, and his study of mathematics and the physical sciences affected
his general metaphysical position—so much so that the two are often difficult to disentangle. His discussions of
infinitesimals are interwoven with arguments about _minima sensibilia_ and with his doctrine that, for sensible objects,
_esse is percipi_; his discussion in the _Principles of human knowledge_ of algebra and of geometric reasoning is bound
up with his view of language and his rejection of abstract ideas; his critique of the foundations of the calculus is
motivated by many of the same epistemological considerations that underlie his critique of the idea of material
substance. It is these connections (rather than his powerful but already-known logical criticisms of Newton's reasoning
in the _Principia_) that give his philosophy of mathematics its depth and its strength and its present interest.

Despite the penetration of his writings—their wealth of implications both for mathematics and for philosophy - Berkeley
had little actual influence on the development of mathematics. He was nobody's inspiration, and indeed to this day is
rarely thought of as a philosopher of mathematics at all. The nineteenth century remembered him principally as an
ingenious paradoxer, the precursor of Hume who had denied the existence of material substance; his writings on
mathematics have largely been forgotten. (Two exceptions are reproduced below: _MacLaurin_ and the correspondence
between William Rowan Hamilton and Augustus De Morgan.) But even if Berkeley did not himself initiate or influence the
great period of nineteenth-century foundational research, he nevertheless glimpsed many of its central themes; and his
writings are therefore an appropriate starting-point for these volumes
