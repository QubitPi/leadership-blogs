[Major Themes and Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Twist#Major_themes_and_symbols)
--------------------------

In Oliver Twist, Dickens mixes grim realism with merciless satire to describe the effects of industrialism on
19th-century England and to criticise the harsh new Poor Laws. __Oliver__, an innocent child, is trapped in a world
where his only options seem to be the workhouse, a life of crime symbolised by Fagin's gang, a prison, or an early
grave. From this unpromising industrial/institutional setting, however, a fairy tale also emerges. In the midst of
corruption and degradation, the essentially passive Oliver _remains pure-hearted; he steers away from evil when those
around him give in to it_, and in proper fairy-tale fashion, he eventually receives his reward - leaving for a peaceful
life in the country, surrounded by kind friends. On the way to this happy ending, Dickens explores the kind of life an
outcast, orphan boy could expect to lead in 1830s London

__Nancy__, by contrast, redeems herself at the cost of her own life and dies in a prayerful pose. She is one of the few
characters in Oliver Twist to display much ambivalence. Her storyline in the novel strongly reflects themes of domestic
violence and psychological abuse at the hands of Bill. Although Nancy is a full-fledged criminal, indoctrinated and
trained by Fagin since childhood, she retains enough empathy to repent her role in Oliver's kidnapping, and to take
steps to try to atone. As one of Fagin's victims, corrupted but not yet morally dead, she gives eloquent voice to the
horrors of the old man's little criminal empire. She wants to save Oliver from a similar fate; at the same time, she
recoils from the idea of turning traitor, especially to Bill Sikes, whom she loves. When Dickens was later criticised
for giving to a "thieving, whoring slut of the streets" such an unaccountable reversal of character, he ascribed her
change of heart to "the last fair drop of water at the bottom of a dried-up, weed-choked well".

Leadership is, at root, about Influencing Others
------------------------------------------------

At the end of the day, the movie symbolizes the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule)

When dealing with the huge pressure of meeting deadlines or attaining shareholder profitability targets, in most cases,
the Golden Rule tends to be forgotten by employers. In this respect, business leaders need to stop putting corporate
priorities and greed above the needs of employees. I am not arguing for an end of profit, but to prevent businesses from
profiting from employee harm and potential exploitation. Profits should be a product of an organisationâ€™s purpose, but
not the purpose of the organisation.
