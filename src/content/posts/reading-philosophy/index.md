  People who are interested in Philosophy but not a Philosophy major doesn't like the overly complicated style of
  writing where everything is symbolic or metaphorical and have to dig for the meaning instead of it just being clearly
  stated. For example, reading Newton's principia feels struggling for really understanding the work not because the
  ideas in it are too complicated, but because reaching the ideas feels like going through a maze of unnecessary jargon
  to reach them, and by the time one has made it through all that, people become too mentally drained to even digest
  what they're really saying. Is there anything wrong?

It is an interesting assumption that people without background in academic Philosophy think that one have to read the
primary sources with verify little hand holding. Studying both Physics and Philosophy, I have literally never in my life
met someone that tries to access Physics by reading the primary academic literature. 

Literally nobody interested in Physics starts by trying to read Newton's principia.  If one is interested in Philosophy
and doesn't have any training in it, why not start with Philosophy textbooks just like how we study Physics in college?
These university level introductory texts take these complex and often unfriendly primary texts and parse them for us.

Philosophy ('love of wisdom' in Ancient Greek) is a systematic study of general and fundamental questions concerning
topics like existence, reason, knowledge, value, mind, and language. It is a rational and critical inquiry that reflects
on its methods and assumptions. Philosophical questions can be grouped into several branches.
[Metaphysics](#metaphysics), [Epistemology](#epistemology), [Logic](#logic), and Ethics are sometimes listed as the main branches.

Epistemology
------------

__Epistemology__ is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge. It is also known as __theory of knowledge__ and aims to
understand what knowledge is, how it arises, what its limits are, and what value it has. It further examines the nature
of truth, belief, justification, and rationality. Some of the questions addressed by epistemologists include
"By what method(s) can one acquire knowledge?"; "How is truth established?"; and "Can we prove causal relations?"

One area in epistemology asks how people acquire knowledge. According to empiricists, all knowledge is based on some
form of experience. Rationalists reject this view and hold that some forms of knowledge, like innate knowledge, are not
acquired through experience

Unlike the fields of Psychology which is also interested in beliefs and related cognitive processes by studying the
beliefs people actually have and how people acquire them, epistemology explores how people should acquire beliefs. It
determines which beliefs or forms of belief acquisition meet the standards or epistemic goals of knowledge and which
ones fail, thereby providing an evaluation of beliefs. In this regard, epistemology is a normative discipline, whereas
psychology and cognitive sociology are descriptive disciplines

The word epistemology comes from the ancient Greek terms <span class="greek-text">ἐπιστήμη</span> (_episteme_, meaning
_knowledge_ or _understanding_) and <span class="greek-text">λόγος</span> (_logos_, meaning _study of_ or reason), literally,
the study of knowledge. Despite its ancient roots, the word itself was only coined in the 19th century to designate this
field as a distinct branch of philosophy.

### Major Schools of Thought

#### Skepticism and Fallibilism

Philosophical skepticism questions the human ability to attain knowledge by challenging the foundations upon which
knowledge claims rest. Some skeptics limit their criticism to specific domains of knowledge. For example, religious
skeptics say that it is impossible to know about the existence of deities or the truth of other religious doctrines.
Similarly, moral skeptics challenge the existence of moral knowledge and metaphysical skeptics say that humans cannot
know ultimate reality. External world skepticism questions knowledge of external facts, whereas skepticism about other
minds doubts knowledge of the mental states of others.

Fallibilism is another response to skepticism. Fallibilists agree with skeptics that absolute certainty is impossible.
They reject the assumption that knowledge requires absolute certainty, leading them to the conclusion that fallible
knowledge exists. They emphasize the need to keep an open and inquisitive mind, acknowledging that doubt can never be
fully excluded, even for well-established knowledge claims like thoroughly tested scientific theories

#### Empiricism and Rationalism

The debate between empiricism and rationalism centers on the origins of human knowledge. Empiricism emphasizes that
sense experience is the primary source of all knowledge. Some empiricists illustrate this view by describing the mind as
a blank slate that only develops ideas about the external world through the sense data received from the sensory organs.
According to them, the mind can attain various additional insights by comparing impressions, combining them,
generalizing to form more abstract ideas, and deducing new conclusions from them. Empiricists say that all these mental
operations depend on sensory material and do not function on their own.

Even though rationalists usually accept sense experience as one source of knowledge, they argue that certain forms of
knowledge are directly accessed through reason without sense experience, like knowledge of mathematical and logical
truths

Metaphysics
-----------

__Metaphysics__ is the study of the most general features of reality, such as existence, objects and their properties,
wholes and their parts, space and time, events, and causation. Metaphysicians attempt to answer basic questions
including "Why is there something rather than nothing?"; "Of what does reality ultimately consist?"; and "Are humans
free?"

:::tip[The Fundamental Question of Metaphysics]

"__Why is there anything at all?__" or "__Why is there something rather than nothing?__" is a question about the reason
for basic existence which has been raised or commented on by a range of philosophers and physicists who called it "[the
fundamental question of metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_is_there_anything_at_all%3F)"

:::

Metaphysics encompasses a wide range of general and abstract topics. It investigates the nature of existence, the
features all entities have in common, and their division into [categories of being]. An influential division is between _particulars_ and
_universals_. Particulars are individual unique entities, like a specific apple. Universals are general features that
different particulars have in common, like the color red. Metaphysicians also explore the [concepts of space, time, and
change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_space_and_time), and their connection to
[causality](https://leadership.qubitpi.org/posts/causality/) and the [laws of
nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_laws). Other topics include how [mind and matter are
related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_problem), whether everything in the world is predetermined, and whether there is free will.

An important area in metaphysics is [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology). Some theorists identify it with general metaphysics. Ontology investigates concepts like _being_, _becoming_, and _reality_. It studies the [categories of being] and asks what exists on the most fundamental level. Another subfield of metaphysics is [philosophical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_cosmology). It is interested in the essence of the world as a whole. It asks questions including whether the universe has a beginning and an end and whether it was created by something else

A key topic in metaphysics concerns the question of whether reality only consists of physical things like matter and energy. Alternative suggestions are that mental entities (such as souls and experiences) and abstract entities (such as numbers) exist apart from physical things. Another topic in metaphysics concerns the problem of identity. One question is how much an entity can change while still remaining the same entity. According to one view, entities have essential and accidental features. They can change their accidental features but they cease to be the same entity if they lose an essential feature

The roots of metaphysics lie in antiquity with speculations about the nature and origin of the universe, like those found in the _Upanishads_ in ancient India, _Daoism_ in ancient China, and _pre-Socratic philosophy_ in ancient Greece. During the subsequent medieval period in the West, discussions about the nature of universals were influenced by the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. The modern period saw the emergence of various comprehensive systems of metaphysics, many of which embraced idealism. In the 20th century, traditional metaphysics in general and idealism in particular faced various criticisms, which prompted new approaches to metaphysical inquiry.

:::tip[Idealism]

__Idealism__ in philosophy, also known as philosophical realism or metaphysical idealism, is the set of metaphysical
perspectives asserting that, most fundamentally, reality is equivalent to mind, spirit, or consciousness; that reality
is entirely a mental construct; or that ideas are the highest type of reality or have the greatest claim to being
considered "real".

Wang Yangming (<span class="chinese-text">王阳明</span> )'s thought has been interpreted as a kind of idealism in China:

- <span class="chinese-text">人的内心自然包含世界运行的规则（心即理）</span>[^1]
- <span class="chinese-text">“理”全在心“心”，“理”化生宇宙天地万物</span> [^1]

Logic
-----

### Deductive Logic [^2]

Over the centuries, a variety of systems of deductive logic have been developed. One of the oldest is
[_Euclid's Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements), the axiomatization of plane geometry developed
around 300 BCE in classical Greece. All of the truths or theorems of plane geometry can be derived from the _five_
fundamental assumptions or axioms of Euclid's system. Many have attempted to axiomatize other areas of knowledge,
including many of the sciences and many areas of mathematics. For example,
[Giuseppe Peano successfully axiomatized arithmetic in 1889](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetices_principia,_nova_methodo_exposita).

:::tip[The Five Fundamental Axioms of Euclid's Elements]

1. <span class="greek-text">᾿Ηιτήσθω ἀπὸ παντὸς σημείου ἐπὶ πᾶν σημεῖον εὐθεῖαν γραμμὴν ἀγαγεῖν.</span>
2. <span class="greek-text">Καὶ πεπερασμένην εὐθεῖαν κατὰ τὸ συνεχὲς ἐπ᾿ εὐθείας ἐκβαλεῖν.</span>
3. <span class="greek-text">Καὶ παντὶ κέντρῳ καὶ διαστήματι κύκλον γράφεσθαι.</span>
4. <span class="greek-text">Καὶ πάσας τὰς ὀρθὰς γωνίας ἴσας ἀλλήλαις εἶναι.</span>
5. <span class="greek-text">Καὶ ἐὰν εἰς δύο εὐθείας εὐθεῖα ἐμπίπτουσα τὰς ἐντὸς καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ αὐτὰ μέρη γωνίας δύο ὀρθῶν
   ἐλάσσονας ποιῇ, ἐκβαλλομένας τὰς δύο εὐθείας ἐπ᾿ ἄπειρον συμπίπτειν, ἐφ᾿ ἃ μέρη εἰσὶν αἱ τῶν δύο ὀρθῶν
   ἐλάσσονες.</span> [^3]

Most of the theorems appearing in the Elements were not discovered by Euclid himself, but were the work of earlier Greek
mathematicians such as [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) (and his school),
[Hippocrates of Chios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates_of_Chios),
[Theaetetus of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theaetetus_(mathematician)), and
[Eudoxus of Cnidos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus). However, Euclid is generally credited with
arranging these theorems in a logical manner.[^3]

:::

Studying deductive logic by learning to symbolize natural language sentences (such as English sentences) in a formal
language, one becomes more aware and more appreciative of the importance of the structure and complexities of natural
languages. The specific words that we use have a direct bearing on whether a piece of reasoning is valid or invalid. For
example, it is essential to distinguish between "Roberta will pass if she completes all the homework" and "Roberta will
pass only if she completes all the homework" if we want to reason well about Roberta's prospects for passing. Finally,
the concepts that we explore here are abstract concepts. Learning to think about abstract concepts and the relations
between them is an important skill that is useful in a wide range of theoretical and applied disciplines.

Now let's explore the core concepts of deductive logic, starting with basic definitions:

:::note[Definitions]

- An __argument__ is a set of two or more sentences, one of which is designated as the conclusion and the others as the
_premises_ (English sentences).
- An argument is __logically valid__ if and only if it is not possible for all the premises to be true and the
  conclusion false. An argument is _logically invalid_ if and only if it is not logically valid. In this sense, a
  logically valid argument is __truth-preserving__ (always taking one from truth to another truth, never falsehood)
