Determinism is a philosophical concept that addresses the nature of causality and its implications for the universe and
our place within it. At its core, determinism is the belief that all events, including human actions, are ultimately
determined by causes external to the will. In other words, for every event that occurs, there are conditions that could
not have caused any other event. This idea has profound implications for our understanding of free will, morality, and
the very nature of reality.

There are different types of determinism, including:

1. __Hard Determinism__: This view asserts that every event, including human decisions, is completely caused by prior
   events and cannot be influenced by free will.
2. __Soft Determinism__: This position suggests that while our choices may not be entirely determined, they are still
   the result of a complex interplay of causes and conditions.
3. __Compatibilist Determinism__: This view argues that free will and determinism are compatible, meaning that it is
   possible to have free will without being completely controlled by prior events.

Kant on Determinism
-------------------

Immanuel Kant's position on determinism is complex and nuanced. He was neither a strict determinist nor a simple
libertarian, but a compatibilist of a unique kind. He grappled deeply with the apparent contradiction between determinism and
free will, proposing a sophisticated solution known as his __two-standpoint theory__:

1. __Determinism in the Phenomenal World__ 

  - Kant argued that as far as the world of appearances (the phenomenal world) is concerned, everything is subject to
    the laws of cause and effect. This is the world we experience through our senses and which science investigates.
  - From a scientific or empirical perspective, human actions, like all other events, can be understood as determined by
    prior causes (our empirical character, circumstances, psychological drives, etc.). So, in this sense, when we view
    ourselves or others as objects in the empirical world, our actions appear to be determined.

2. __Freedom in the Noumenal World__

  - However, Kant also posited a noumenal world (the world of "things-in-themselves"), which lies beyond our sensory
    experience and is accessible only through reason.
  - In this noumenal realm, he argued that human beings possess transcendental freedom. This is a different kind of
    causality - a causality of reason itself, unconditioned by prior empirical causes.
  - For Kant, this freedom is not something we can empirically prove or know in the same way we know scientific laws.
    Instead, it's a postulate of practical reason, meaning we must assume it to be true in order for morality and moral
    responsibility to make sense. If we weren't truly free to choose our actions, then holding people accountable for
    them (praise or blame) would be meaningless.

Kant explicitly addressed the apparent conflict between determinism and freedom as one of his "Antinomies of Pure
Reason" in the _Critique of Pure Reason_. An __antinomy__ is a pair of seemingly contradictory but equally defensible
propositions. He argued that the contradiction arises from trying to apply categories of understanding (like causality)
beyond their proper domain (the phenomenal world) to the noumenal world.

:::note

In essence, Kant holds that 

- Our actions, as phenomena, are indeed determined by natural laws.
- Yet, we are also free as noumenal beings, capable of acting from reason and moral duty, independent of empirical
  influences.

This "two-standpoint" approach allows him to affirm the validity of scientific determinism while simultaneously
preserving the possibility of moral responsibility and human freedom. While it's a profound and influential solution, it
has also been a subject of extensive debate and interpretation among philosophers ever since.

:::

The core ideas regarding Kant's two-standpoint theory concerning freedom and determinism are primarily discussed in his
most significant work on theoretical philosophy - ___Critique of Pure Reason___, the foundational text where Kant lays
out his transcendental idealism, the distinction between the phenomenal (appearances) and noumenal
(things-in-themselves) worlds. In the __Third Antinomy of Pure Reason__, within the "Transcendental Dialectic" section,
Kant explicitly sets up the apparent contradiction between "causality according to the laws of nature" (determinism) and
"causality through freedom." He then resolves this antinomy by introducing his two-standpoint solution: that we are
determined as phenomena in the empirical world but free as noumena.

Newtonian Mechanics and General Relativity
------------------------------------------

Determinism in the West is often associated with
[Newtonian mechanics/physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics), which depicts the physical matter of
the universe as operating according to a set of fixed laws. The "billiard ball" hypothesis, a product of Newtonian
physics, argues that once the initial conditions of the universe have been established, the rest of the history of the
universe follows inevitably. If it were actually possible to have complete knowledge of physical matter and all of the
laws governing that matter at any one time, then it would be theoretically possible to compute the time and place of
every event that will ever occur ([Laplace's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon)). In this sense,
the basic particles of the universe operate in the same fashion as the rolling balls on a billiard table, moving and
striking each other in predictable ways to produce predictable results.

Whether or not it is all-encompassing in so doing, Newtonian mechanics deals only with caused events; for example, if an
object begins in a known position and is hit dead on by an object with some known velocity, then it will be pushed
straight toward another predictable point. If it goes somewhere else, the Newtonians argue, one must question one's
measurements of the original position of the object, the exact direction of the striking object, gravitational or other
fields that were inadvertently ignored, etc. Then, they maintain, repeated experiments and improvements in accuracy will
always bring one's observations closer to the theoretically predicted results. When dealing with situations on an
ordinary human scale, Newtonian physics has been successful. But __it fails as velocities become some substantial
fraction of the speed of light and when interactions at the atomic scale are studied__. Before the discovery of
quantum effects and other challenges to Newtonian physics, "uncertainty" was always a term that applied to the accuracy
of human knowledge about causes and effects, and not to the causes and effects themselves.

Newtonian mechanics, as well as any following physical theories, are results of observations and experiments, and so
they describe "how it all works" within a tolerance. However, old western scientists believed if there are any logical
connections found between an observed cause and effect, there must be also some absolute natural laws behind. Belief in
perfect natural laws driving everything, instead of just describing what we should expect, led to searching for a set of
universal simple laws that rule the world. This movement significantly encouraged deterministic views in Western
philosophy.

There are discussions about determinism in the context of General Relativity (__GR__). While GR itself is a
deterministic theory, its predictions and implications have been subject to interpretations that touch on the nature
of determinism.

In classical GR, the Einstein Field Equations describe how mass and energy warp spacetime, leading to gravitational
fields. The equations are deterministic, meaning that if we know the initial conditions (e.g., the distribution of
matter and energy) and follow them carefully, we can predict the entire evolution of the universe.

However, some aspects of GR have led to discussions about determinism:

1. __Initial Conditions and Determinacy__: In classical GR, the initial conditions are crucial in determining the fate
   of a system. However, the theory's deterministic nature raises questions about the role of quantum fluctuations or
   other non-deterministic influences on the initial conditions.
2. __Black Hole Information Paradox__: The paradox highlights the apparent loss of information when matter falls into a
   black hole. Some interpretations, such as Hawking's black hole complementarity, suggest that information is preserved
   in a way that's still deterministic, while others propose that it's encoded in quantum states or other
   non-deterministic frameworks.
3. __Quantum Gravity and Determinism__: The development of quantum gravity theories, such as loop quantum gravity (LQG)
   or string theory, aims to merge GR with quantum mechanics. In these approaches, determinism is often compromised due
   to the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.
4. __Causal Dynamical Triangulation (CDT)__: CDT is a quantum gravity theory that uses a discretized spacetime, similar
   to LQG. It has been shown to be a deterministic theory, but its predictive power and fundamental laws are still
   being explored.
5. __Relational Quantum Mechanics__: This approach posits that reality arises from the relationships between observers
   and the physical world. In this framework, determinism is not necessarily tied to a fixed set of initial conditions.

While GR itself is generally considered deterministic, its extensions, interpretations, and potential mergers with
quantum mechanics have led to debates about determinism in these contexts. The discussions continue to be an active area
of research, with ongoing efforts to reconcile the principles of GR with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.

Quantum Mechanics
-----------------

Before Quantum Mechanics, [Newtonian physics](#newtonian-mechanics-and-general-relativity) dominated. Modern quantum
mechanics, however, casts reasonable doubt on this main thesis of determinism. Quantum mechanics is the product of a
careful application of the scientific method, logic and empiricism. Through a large number of careful experiments
physicists developed a rather unintuitive mental model: A particle's path cannot be specified in from its quantum
description. "Path" is a classical, practical attribute in everyday life, but one that quantum particles do not possess.
Quantum mechanics attributes probability to all possible paths and asserts the only one outcome will be observed.

![](./img/feynman-paths.png)

The randomness in quantum mechanics derives from the quantum aspect of the model. Different experimental results are
obtained for eachook  individual quanta. Some (including Albert Einstein) have argued that the inability to predict any more
than probabilities is simply due to ignorance. The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws can be observed or
deduced, there are also hidden factors or "[hidden variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory)"
that determine absolutely in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that the course of the universe
is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. So, they say, it
only appears that things proceed in a probabilistic way.

Cause and Effect
-----------------

This article is an overview of the Cause and Effect as the Principle of Causality, establishing one event or action as
the direct result of another, from the following 4 perspectives:

1. [Kant's Metaphysics](#kants-metaphysics)
2. [Aristotle's Philosophy](#aristotles-western-philosophy)
3. [Chinese Yin-Yang](#span-classchinese-text中国阴阳学说span)
4. [Buddhism's Karma](#buddhist-philosophy)

### Kant's Metaphysics

The nature of cause and effect is a concern of the subject known as metaphysics. Kant primarily discusses the concept of
cause and effect in the __Division One - Book II - Section III - 3.B. Second
analogy of his [_Critique of Pure Reason_](https://leadership.qubitpi.org/posts/kritik-der-reinen-vernunft/)__:

:::tip[Law of Causality - 1st Version]
Everything that happens (begins to be) presupposes something which it follows in accordance with a rule.
:::

:::tip[Law of Causality - 2nd Version]
All alterations occur in accordance with the law of the connection of cause and effect.
:::

He thought that time and space
were notions prior to human understanding of the progress or evolution of the world, and he also recognized the priority
of causality. But he did not have the understanding that came with knowledge of [Minkowski geometry] and the
[Special Theory of Relativity], that the notion of causality can be used as a prior foundation from which to
[construct notions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_structure) of time and space[^1]

### Aristotle's (Western) Philosophy

__In Book II, Chapter 3 of his work [_Physics_](https://trello.com/c/fIM7TADB)__, Aristotle considered in how many
senses "because" may answer the question "why". He believes understanding a thing means knowing its "how and why" and
gave the following rough classification of the causal determinants of things: 

:::tip[The meaning of physics in Aristotle]

Aristotle's _Physics_ deals with the most general (philosophical) principles of natural or moving things, both living
and non-living, rather than physical theories (in the modern sense) or investigations of the particular contents of the
universe. The chief purpose of the work is to discover the principles and causes of change, or movement, or motion,
especially that of natural wholes (mostly living things, but also inanimate wholes like the cosmos).[^2]

Therefore the "_process_" in the discussion below is nothing but just the movement of a thing from one place to another,
such as a vehicle head toward San Francisco from Los Angeles. 

:::

1. _Material Cause_ - _The existence of material for the generating process to start from_. For example, bronze _for_
   the statue
2. _Formal Cause_ - _The material must receives the form (characteristics) of the type which conforms to its own
   definition_
3. _Efficient Cause_ - _There must be something to initiate a process for change and cease the process when completed_,
   i.e. changing from what it was to what it is to be. According to [_Lloyd_](https://trello.com/c/V3QZplQN), of the
   four causes, only this one is what is meant by the modern English word "cause" in ordinary speech[^1].
4. _Final Cause_ - The _end_ or purpose of the process being initiated. For instance, people exercise for their health.

Often, several of the 4 coalesce one another to produce a single effect and the same cause is often alleged for its
opposite effects. For instance if the pilot's presence would have brought the ship safe to harbour, we say that he
caused its wreck by his absence. 

In addition, none of them are the causes or effects of others. For example, we may say that a man is in fine condition
because he has been in training, or that he has been in training because of the good condition he expected as the
result. But one is the cause as aim (Final Cause) and the other as initiating the process (Efficient Cause).

### Buddhist Philosophy

[Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) (Sanskrit: _कर्म_) is the causality principle focusing on 1) causes, 2)
actions, 3) effects, where it is the mind's phenomena that guide the actions that the actor performs. Buddhism trains 3)
the actor's actions for continued and uncontrived virtuous outcomes aimed at reducing suffering. This follows the 4)
_Subject-verb-object_ structure[^1]

All the classic Buddhist schools teach Karma. "The law of karma is a special instance of the law of cause and effect,
according to which all our actions of body, speech, and mind are causes and all our experiences are their effects."[^1]

A common theme to theories of karma is its principle of causality. This relationship between karma and causality is a
central motif in all schools of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain thought. One of the earliest associations of karma to
causality occurs in the [__Brihadaranyaka Upanishad__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihadaranyaka_Upanishad) verses
4.4.5 - 6:[^4]

:::note

Now as a man is like this or like that,

according as he acts and according as he behaves, so will he be;

a man of good acts will become good, a man of bad acts, bad;

he becomes pure by pure deeds, bad by bad deeds;


And here they say that a person consists of desires,

and as is his desire, so is his will;

and as is his will, so is his deed;

and whatever deed he does, that he will reap.

(Brihadaranyaka Upanishad)

#### Taoism

Karma is an important concept in Taoism. Every deed is tracked by deities and spirits. Appropriate rewards or
retribution follow karma, just like a shadow follows a person.

Conclusion
----------

The _current_ state of the art in Philosophy (particularly in Kant) and Science (GR & Quantum) seem to suggest that our
reality would be neither deterministic or non-deterministic but a mix or a new concept that human has yet to discover.
