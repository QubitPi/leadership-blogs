  I study Social Psychology in order to get insights about myself. A book on Social Psychology sparked my interests on
  this field so I picked up a text book about it. The notion of "Fundamental Attribution Error" and its application on
  World War II German society ignited my examination on my past 30 years of life as a Chinese.

Social psychologists examine how the presence of others impacts how a person behaves and reacts and believe that _a
person's behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation and the composition of social groups_

:::important[Base Assumption of Social Psychology]

A person's behavior is influenced by who else is present in a given situation and the composition of social groups

:::

Behavior is a product of both the situation (e.g., cultural influences, social roles, and the presence of bystanders)
and of the person (e.g., personality characteristics). Subfields of psychology tend to focus on one influence or
behavior over others. __Situationism__ is the view that our behavior and actions are determined by our immediate
environment and surroundings. In contrast, __dispositionism__ holds that our behavior is determined by internal factors
(personality traits and temperament of person). Modern approaches to social psychology, however, take both the situation
and the individual into account when studying human behavior

Fundamental Attribution Error
-----------------------------

_In the U.S._, the predominant culture tends to favor a dispositional approach in explaining human behavior, because
people there tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and, therefore, any behavior change must
be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or temperament. This is called __fundamental
attribution error__

:::important[Prevailing Implicit Assumption of Western Social Psychology]

People tend to assume that the behavior of another person is a trait of that person, and to underestimate the power of
the situation on the behavior of others. They tend to overemphasize internal factors as explanations - or attributions -
for the behavior of other people and tend to fail to recognize when the behavior of another is due to situational
variables, and thus to the person's state.

For example, Jamie returns home from work, and opens the front door to a happy greeting from spouse Morgan who inquires
how the day has been. Instead of returning the spouse's kind greeting, Jamie yells, "Leave me alone!" Why did Jamie
yell? How would someone committing the fundamental attribution error explain Jamie's behavior? The most common response
is that Jamie is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (traits). This is an internal or dispositional explanation.
However, imagine that Jamie was just laid off from work due to company downsizing. Would the explanation for Jamie's
behavior change? The revised explanation might be that Jamie was frustrated and disappointed about being laid off and
was therefore in a bad mood (state). This is now an external or situational explanation for Jamie's behavior.

:::

Such a culture in western countries, such as the U.S. and UK, that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy is
called __individualistic culture__, which has the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error. In
contrast to the western countries's __individualistic culture__, the east Asia countries, Latin American, and African
countries focus on the group more than on the individual, forming a __collectivistic culture__, which takes into account
both situational and cultural influences on behaviors. The table below summarizes their differences:

|   Individualistic Culture   |  Collectivistic Culture   |
|:---------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|    Achievement oriented     |   Relationship oriented   |
|      Focus on autonomy      |  Focus on group harmony   |
|  Dispositional perspective  |  Situational perspective  |
|         Independent         |      Interdependent       |
|   Analytic thinking style   |  Holistic thinking style  |

One consequence of westerners' tendency to provide dispositional explanations for behavior is victim blame. When people
experience bad fortune, others tend to assume that they somehow are responsible for their own fate. A common ideology,
or worldview, in the United States is the just-world hypothesis. The __just-world hypothesis__ is the belief that people
get the outcomes they deserve. In order to maintain the belief that the world is a fair place, people tend to think that
good people experience positive outcomes, and bad people experience negative outcomes. _The ability to think of the
world as a fair place, where people get what they deserve, allows us to feel that the world is predictable and that we
have some control over our life outcomes_. For example, if we want to experience positive outcomes, we just need to work
hard to get ahead in life.

:::caution[Negative Consequence of the Just-World Hypothesis]

People tend to blame poor individuals for their plight. Blaming poor people for their poverty ignores situational
factors that impact them, such as high unemployment rates, recession, poor educational opportunities, and the familial
cycle of poverty

:::

### Extension of FA: Actor-Observer Bias & Self-Serving Bias

Returning to our earlier example, Jamie was laid off, but an observer would not know. So a na√Øve observer would tend to
attribute Jamie's hostile behavior to Jamie's disposition rather than to the true, situational cause. One reason is that
we often don't have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person's behavior. The
only information we might have is what is observable. Due to this lack of information we have a tendency to assume the
behavior is due to a dispositional, or internal, factor. When it comes to explaining our own behaviors, however, we
have much more information available to us. If we came home from school or work angry and yelled at our dog or a loved
one, what would our explanation be? We might say we were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time - a
situational explanation. The __actor-observer bias__ is the phenomenon of attributing other people's behavior to
internal factors (fundamental attribution error) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces. As actors of
behavior, we have more information available to explain our own behavior. However as observers, we have less information
available; therefore, we tend to default to a dispositionist perspective.

Following an outcome, self-serving biases are those attributions that enable us to see ourselves in a favorable light
(for example, making internal attributions for success and external attributions for failures). When we do
well at a task, for example acing an exam, it is in our best interest to make a dispositional attribution for our
behavior ("I'm smart") instead of a situational one ("The exam was easy"). __Self-serving bias__ is the tendency to
explain our successes as due to dispositional (internal) characteristics, but to explain our failures as due to
situational (external) factors. Again, this is culture dependent. __This bias serves to protect self-esteem__. We can
imagine that if people always made situational attributions for their behavior, they would never be able to take
credit and feel good about their accomplishments

### Case Study - World War II Germany

During World War II, Germany exhibited characteristics of a collectivist culture, particularly under the Nazi regime.
While Germany is generally considered an individualistic culture today, the Nazi regime emphasized collective identity,
national unity, and obedience to the state, prioritizing the needs of the nation above individual desires. This was
achieved through propaganda, strict social control, and suppression of dissent.

#### Nazi Ideology and Collectivism

The Nazi regime promoted a strong sense of national identity and collective purpose, emphasizing the "Volksgemeinschaft"
(people's community). This involved subordinating individual interests to the goals of the state, particularly in areas
like military service, economic production, and racial purity.

#### Propaganda and Social Control

The Nazi regime used extensive propaganda to shape public opinion, glorify the nation, and demonize its enemies. This
propaganda often appealed to a sense of collective identity and purpose, fostering a sense of unity and shared destiny.
Strict social controls were also implemented to ensure conformity and suppress dissent, further reinforcing the
collective mindset

#### Suppression of Individualism

The Nazi regime actively discouraged individualism and independent thought, particularly among those deemed
"undesirable". Dissent was met with harsh punishment, including imprisonment and execution. This suppression of
individual expression and critical thinking contributed to a culture of conformity and obedience to the state.

Self-Presentation
-----------------

As we have [discussed earlier](#fundamental-attribution-error), both dispositional and situational factors affect one
another's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In this section, we set the dispositional factors aside and examine
situational forces that have a strong influence on human behavior. These include

- [social roles](#social-roles)
- [social norms](#social-norms)
- [scripts](#scripts)

### Social Roles

:::tip[Social Role]

A __social role__ is a pattern of behavior that is expected of a person in a given setting or group

:::

### Social Norms

:::tip[Social Norm]

A __social norm__ is a group's expectation of what is appropriate and acceptable behavior for its members - how they are
supposed to behave and think

:::

Each one of us has several social roles. One may be, at the same time, a student, a parent, an aspiring teacher, a son
or daughter, a spouse, and a lifeguard. These social roles influence our behaviors. 

### Scripts

Reading Notes of "INFLUENCE The Psychology of Persuasion"
---------------------------------------------------------

<iframe width="100%" height="468" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MzBY0-2h3ck" title="Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion By Robert B Cialdini - Audiobook" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The ever-accelerating pace and informational crush of modern life have been utilized to produce a distinct kind of
automatic, mindless compliance from people, that is, a willingness to say "yes" without thinking first. This particular
form of unthinking compliance will become more prevalent in the future. It will be increasingly important, therefore,
for the society to understand the how and why of automatic influence.

[This book](https://ia800203.us.archive.org/33/items/ThePsychologyOfPersuasion/The%20Psychology%20of%20Persuasion.pdf)
is about the Psychology of compliance and helps us, as victims, identify the techniques of compliance professionals who
have been using the principles on us in a daily basis. The author of the book combines the school principles with 3-year
outside-of-school real experiences with compliance professionals, such as sales representatives, to produce the 6
fundamental psychological principles that direct human behaviors:

1. [Reciprocation](#reciprocation)
2. Consistency
3. Social Proof
4. Authority
5. Liking
6. Scarcity

__It's a good book that reminds us that persuasion is rooted in building genuine connections__

<iframe width="100%" height="468" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFdCzN7RYbw" title="Science Of Persuasion" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Reciprocation
-------------

:::important[Rule for Reciprocation]

We should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us

:::

Human societies derive a truly significant competitive advantage from the reciprocity rule, and consequently the
political authorities make sure their members are trained to comply with and believe in it. As a result, there is
general distaste for those who take but make no effort to give in return, and we will avoid being considered as such
persons. __It is those attempts of such avoidance that individuals find opportunities to take advantage of on us__

Although we all agree that people are more willing to do a favor for someone they like, under the rule of reciprocation,
even the relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped out, demonstrating the overpowering
effectiveness of the rule. For those who owed somebody a favor, it made no difference whether they like that person or
not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him.

People we might ordinarily dislike, such as an unwelcome sales operator, disagreeable acquaintances, or even an
unpopular organization, can greatly increase the chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us
with a small favor prior to their requests. Such small favor could be the "free sample" in marketing fields, a free
book, or even a flower, or even the acceptance of a refusal followed by a smaller compliance request.

One feature of the reciprocity is that a small initial favor can trigger a substantially larger return favor. This is
often exploited by manipulators. The reason for us to accept such unfair exchange is that most of us find it highly
disagreeable to be in a state of obligation. It weighs heavily on us and demands to be removed. For this reason alone,
we may be willing to agree to perform a larger favor than we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological
burden of debt.

Commitment and Consistency
--------------------------

Motivated by the human tendency for continuous commitment, People's desire for consistency has been a central motivation
of our behaviors, because a high degree of consistency is normally associated with personal and intellectual strength
while inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable personality trait. It is at the heart of logic,
rationality, stability, and honesty.

On the other hand, this highly-valued good personal consistency can be disastrous when it occurs unthinkinly. First, it
offers a shortcut through the density of modern life. Once we have made up our minds about an issue, stubborn
consistency allows us a very appealing luxury: We really don't have to think hard about the issue anymore. We need only
believe or do whatever is consistent with our earlier decision. We do so the allure of such a luxury allows us a
convenient, relatively, effortless, and efficient method for dealing with complex daily environments that make severe
demands on our mental energies and capacities. Second, when we are desperately longing for a solution and spot a one
that we think should solve the problem, the tendency of becoming consistent pushes us to our comfort zone by ignoring
any other rational opposing view. In this case, automatic consistency shields us against any painful yet meaningful
thoughts.

Such consistency can also be exploited by those who would prefer that we not think too much in response to their
requests for our compliance. The author mentions the example of toy companies' strategy to boost post-Christmas sales.
Normally, people over-spend during Christmas season which resulted in low sales during post-Christmas period. The toy
companies did the trick with pre-Christmas TV advertisement that shows attractive Christmas toys for children. The
parents would normally promis the advertised toy as Christmas gift for them. But later they _undersupply_ the stores
with these toys and substitute them with other toys of equal values and re-advertise those toys that have gotten the
parents to promise. In the end, the toy companies make double-money with the substitutes and the original toys.

Principle of Social Proof
-------------------------

American public hates canned laughter in television shows. Why, then, is canned laughter so popular with television
executives? Experiments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience to laugh longer and more often
when humorous material is presented and to rate the material as funnier. In addition, some evidence indicates that
canned laughter is more effective for poor jokes. Why would we laugh more given the mechanically fabricated merriment?
The book answers this question by introducing __The Principle of Social Proof__ (__PSP__):

:::tip[The Principle of Social Proof]

One way we use to determine what is correct is to find out what other people think is correct

:::

Example of PSP:

- how fast we drive on highway
- how to eat the chicken at a dinner party
- the actions of those around us

The PSP explains why, on commercial product websites, we see they list companies that are using the products - we see
using their products as more appropriate when others are doing the same thing. In the case of canned laughter, we use
other's laugh to help decide what is humorous and when mirth is appropriate. The fact that we laugh based simply on a
patently fraudulent laughter shows that people can exploit our preference for shortcuts, our tendency to react
automatically on the basis of partial evidence. One example is the aforementioned "cheep-cheep" of baby turkey. The
mother turkey gets fooled by the sound because it makes judgements based only on the sound.

More examples of PSP:

- Bartenders often "salt" their tip jars with a few dollar bills at the beginning of the evening to simulate tips left
  by prior customers and thereby to give the impression that tipping with folding money is proper barroom behavior
- Advertisers list "best-sellers"
- Charity uses incessant listing of donors
- Salesmen are taught to spice their pitches with numerous accounts of individuals who have purchased the product
  ("Since 95% of the people are imitators and only 5% initiators, people are persuaded more by the action of others tha
  by any proof we can offer")

### Application of PSP

#### Elimination of Undesirable Behavior

Showing a video (or a film examples) of a boy playing nicely with a dog helps children to remove fear of dogs. This is
an example of changing people's behavior.

#### We Intend to Follow Others Under Uncertainty

> Book P98 - Cause of a woman's death is due to uncertainty

In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the situation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.**

The story: A woman was murdered on a city street. 30 bystanders who observed the process never called police.

Analysis: Bypassing the sayings of those observers (e.g. "I don't know; I don't want to get involved") as well as the peripheral observations about people being unfeeling in a "Cold Society", the core issue lies in PSP: _**In times of such uncertainty, the natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues. We can learn, from the way the other witnesses are reacting, whether the event is or is not an emergency**_. Bystanders are _**unsure**_ rather than unkind. When they are unsure, they follow others who are also unsure.

_**How to reduce the uncertainty of others: Be certain on what you need**_ (e.g. You, in blue jacket, I need help. Call an ambulance) _**This brings back the original purpose of this book: How to produce compliance with a request - No general request to group of people; pick out one person and assign the task to that person instead; otherwise it is easy for everyone to assume that someone else should help**_. This explains why commercial product website has a chat window - they want to pick up you as that specific person in blue jacket!

#### Inclined to Follow Similarity

_**We are more inclined to follow the lead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one.**_

An example is the advertiser who knows that one successful way to sell a product to ordinary viewers (who compose the largest potential market) is to demonstrate that other "ordinary" people like and use it.

### How to Guard Against the Information That Social Proof Provides

PSP gives us shortcut to make right decisions but not always. The key is to identify the wrong data in the crowd. Purposely falsified social evidence is an example of wrong data. e.g. canned laughter

## Liking

A social rule - _**we most prefer to say yes to the request of someone we know and like**_.

_"It's gotten to the point now where i hate to be invited to Tupperware parties. I've got all the containers I need; and if I wanted any more, I could buy another brand cheaper in the store. But when a friend calls up, I feel like I have to go. And when I get there, I feel like I have to buy something. What can I do? It's for one of my friends"_

Examples:

* charity (P127)
* Endless-chain sales strategy (P128)

### Physical Attractiveness

> Halo Effects - _**A halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dominates the way that person is viewd by others**_

_**Physical attractiveness triggers halo effect. We automatically assign to good-looking individuals such as favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence (we make these judgements without being aware that physical attractiveness plays a role in the process)**_

_**Unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is similarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone structure**_. e.g. handsome man received lighter sentences in criminal trials

Attractive people are more likely to obtain help when in need and are more persuasive in changing the opinions of an audience.

### Similarity

_**In addition to physical appearance, we like people who are similar (opinion, personality, background, life-style) to us**_.

Example

* Dress
* Interests - a strong example: Car salesmen, for example, are trained to look for evidence of such things while examining the customer's trade-in. If there is camping gear in the trunk, the salesman might mention, later on, how he loves to get away from the city whenever he can; if there are golf balls on the back seat, he might remark that he hopes the rain will hold off until he can play the eighteen holes he has schedules for later in the day; if he notices that the car was purchased out of state, he might ask where the customer is from and report - with surprise - that he (or his wife) was born there, too

### Compliments - We are Phenomenal Suckers for Flatter

_**The information that someone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing return liking and willing compliance. So, often in terms of flattery or simple claims of affinity, we hear positive estimation from people who want something from us**_

This reflects a lot of phenomenons in our society:

* why you see those celebrities give holiday greetings on TV
* why you see sales people regularly sends you "happy new year" or "I like you" card.

### Familiarity - Contact & Cooperation

For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us.

Why familiarity plays a role in liking? _**Our attitude toward something is influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past**_.

But this does not apply in all cases (Schooling exception). Hence the concept of "cooperation" is introduced. The concept is illustrated in the following experiment:

Children are splited into 2 competing groups -> Groups starts to fight against each other triggered by the grouping itself -> cooperation. e.g. combined forces to fix water problem, pull food truck, and renting a movie -> the common goals ended the battles between groups -> they become friends

> My thoughts
>
> * This experiment is very similar to video games in which people form 2 competing groups to fight against each other. The psychological effect is that people will separate each other more and more, which is not a great act
> * "The crucial procedure was the experimenters' imposition of common goals on the groups" - Managing a group of people in organization should focus on the innate personal goals of each individual employees

It is important to know when cooperation is appropriate because sometimes competition has its place, too. It can serve as a valuable motivator of desirable action and an important builder of self-concept.

Done with children experiment, the book states that

1. although the familiarity produced by contact usually leads to greater liking, the opposite occurs if the contact carries distasteful experience with it
2. the evidence that team-oriented learning is an antidote to this disorder may tell us about the heavy impact of cooperation on the liking process.

How does all above apply to the persuasion of product buying? _**Compliance professionals are forever attempting to establish that we and they are working for the same goals, that we must "pull together" for mutual benefit, that they are, in essence, our teammates**_

> Thoughts
>
* While choosing from potential employee candidates, organizations must carefully consider the goal alignment between corporate and the individual, so as to let employee do more good tings to their groups.
> * I think this is one of the reason for "Mission Statements"
> * IMPORTANT - example of Good/Bad Cop P150

### Conditioning and Association

There is a natural human tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleasant information, even when that person did not cause the bad news. The simple association with it is enough to stimulate our dislike. Vice Versa - establish connection between product and goodies.

e.g.

* Good-looking models standing around car
* Linking of celebrities to products in advertisement
* Congressional representatives traditionally announce to the press the start of federal projects that will bring new jobs or benefits to their home states; this is true even when a representative has had nothing to do with advancing the project or has, in some cases, voted against it
* Luncheon technique - We become fonder of the people and things we experience while we were eating (food is a source of positiveness)
* Pavlov: If the presentation of food to a god was always accompanied by the sound of a bell, soon the dog would salivate to the bell alone, even when there was no food to be had
* Luncheon technique is an application of Pavlov's experiment: there are many normal responses to food besides salivation, one of the being a good and favorable feeling.

Concentrate on the liking effect rather than preventing it and notice the over-behavior of liking (e.g. the feeling that we have come to like the practitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected).

## Scarcity

> Scarcity Principle (SP) - _**Opportunities seem more valuable to us when their availability is limited**_

The idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value (e.g. homeowners told how much money they could lose from inadequate insulation are more likey to insulate their homes than those told how much money they could save).

A reason that SP works is because as opportunities become less available, we lose freedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have:

> Fundamental of Psychological Reactance Theory - _**Whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain our freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services associated with them) significantly more than previously**_

### Application of SP - "Limited-Number Tactic"

The customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that cannot be guaranteed to last long.

LN tactic assumes that the things that are difficult to possess are typically better than those that are easy to possess - availability decides on quality.

### Application of SP - Fight for Freedom

e.g.

* Romeo and Juliet
* Cigarette ads via woman rights
* Visitor purchases gun in gun-free city - people want what has been banned and therefore to presume that it is more worthwhile

### Extending SP - NEW Scarcity is More Powerful (Cookie Experiment)

Not only do we want the same item more when it is scare, we want it most when we are in competition for it.

e.g.

* "hurry-to-buy" on e-commerce
* Salespeople fake rich buyer/competitor to indecisive customer

### How Do We Say No to Scarcity?

According to the cookie experiment, the joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity but in possessing it.

Whenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item, we must also confront the question of what it is we want from the item. If the answer if that we want the thing for the social, economic, or psychological benefits of possessing something rare, then, fine; scarcity pressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want to pay for it - the less available it it, the more valuable to us it will be. But very often we don't want a thing purely for the sake of owning it. We want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or touch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it. In such cases it is vital to remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or work any better because of their limited availability.

## Metan Tape

Doubling the price of a never-sold jewelry triggered the sold-out of it -> there is a pattern "expensive = good quality" -> There is a specific feature of some identity that triggered human actions (purchase expense jewelry)

The pattern is triggered a tap of actions from us

We have our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually work on our advantage, the trigger features that activate them can be used to dupe us into playing them at the wrong times.

### Example of Mental Tape - Ask for Favor

_**When we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do**_.

The word "**because**" is a trigger of successful compliance request. e.g. cut in line to make copies (Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the Xerox machine because I have to make some copies?)

### Example of Mental Tape - Expensive = Good

e.g. jewelry example above

People learned from past experience that normally the price of an item increases along with its worth. Although it is not always correct, over all of the past and future situations of their lives, betting those shortcut odds may represent the most rational approach possible. **Rich people are more likely to make rational decisions with less amount of time. The extra earned time can be used for other valuable investments, such as reading**.

Why we make such mental shortcuts? Because we don't have the time, energy, or capacity for it. Instead, we must very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb to classify things according to a few key features and then to respond mindlessly when one or another of these trigger features is present. **In today's world, slow = failure. We have to act super quickly on all things to get there faster than others**.

"Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them". Take coupon as an example, we expect discount coupons to do double duty. Not only do we expect them to save us money, we also expect them to save us the time and mental energy required to think about how to do it.

Since most of us know very little about our automatic behavior patterns, they make us terribly vulnerable to anyone who does know how they work.

### Contrast Principle

> Contrast Principle - _**We may be less satisfied with the physical attractiveness of our own lovers because of the way the popular media bombard us with examples of unrealistically attractive models**_.

Examples of Contrast Principle:

* When a man enters a cloth store to buy an expensive three-piece suit and cheap sweater, the sales person will always guide the man to buy the suit first
* Realty salesman shows undesirable houses first and then good houses
