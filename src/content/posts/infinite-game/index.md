Ardeth Bay - My Role Model of A True Leader
-------------------------------------------

The cover image of my leadership blog is __Ardeth Bay__, a Medjai chieftain and warrior in a movie I watched few years
back - [_The Mummy Returns_](https://youtu.be/DtKDPBqMu3o).

Being the descendent of royal Egyptian secret bodyguards also knows as _the Medjai_, Ardeth is the leader of 12 Medjai
tribes that together control tens of thousands of warriors. For over 3000 years, Ardeth along with his Medjai worriors
in desert performs the duty of safeguarding the eternal confinement which prevents the ancient evil supernatural powers
from releasing to this world. 

What captures me most subconsciously about Ardeth was a movie scene where Ardeth laid sat on one of the half-broken bus
chairs for a break after a dangerous yet successful battle with Rick O'Connell's family against 4 enemy mummies on a
double-deck British bus when Rick asked if he's alright, he smiled genuinely and replied:

:::note[Ardeth]

_"This was my first bus-ride"_. (see the clip below)

There are lots of "fake" leaders who enjoys the countless power and wealth and yet there is a true leader who at his
adult age never had the experience of boarding a regular bus. While those fake leaders always shot for short-term gains
for their personal wealth, Ardeth throughout the entire movie is focusing something bigger beyond himself - serving for
his people, his faith, and his value. Wealth, power, or all those luxury lifestyles are meaningless to him. What
distinguish Ardeth from other "leaders" is that Ardeth is truely an earch-touching leader with an
[__infinite-game mindset__](#the-infinite-game1).

There is no "end" for a leader. A leader is not someone who sits at the top enjoying champaign in a glorious golden
house, but instead like Ardeth who hold his position, his integrity, and his faith somewhere in a place where he
belongs, where he is fulfilling the oath of his ancestors' duties, and where he someday shall pass this glorious
responsibility to his next generations and all the way to the _infinite_ future.

The Infinite Game[^1]
---------------------

![](./the-infinite-game.png)

Large groups of people, united in common cause, chose to collaborate with no clear end in sight because we felt like we
were contributing to something bigger than ourselves, something with value that would last well beyond our own lifetimes

It is well within our power to build a world in which the vast majority of us wake up every single morning inspired,
feel safe at work and return home fulfilled at the end of the day

Great leaders are the ones who think beyond "short term" versus "long term." They are the ones who know that it is not
about the next quarter or the next election; it is about the next generation.

When we lead with a finite mindset in an infinite game, it leads to all kinds of problems, the most common of which
include the decline of trust, cooperation and innovation. Leading with an infinite mindset in an infinite game, in
contrast, really does move us in a better direction. Groups that adopt an infinite mindset enjoy vastly higher levels of
trust, cooperation and innovation and all the subsequent benefits.

### Just Cause

Facing competition, we keep being ourselves. Fighting to "win" v.s. Fighting for lives and values

A Just Cause is:

- for something

  - affirmative (not against something) and optimistic
  - inspiring

- Inclusive: serves as an invitation to join others in advancing a cause bigger than ourselves. A clear Cause is what ignites our passions. Infinite-minded leaders actively seek out employees, customers and investors who share a passion for the Just Cause.
- Service oriented - for the primary benefit of others, not company
- Resilient - independent of any physical produce or services
- Idealistic - no matter how much we have achieved, we always feel we have further to go.

### The Responsibility of A Business

The responsibility of business is to use its will and resources to advance a cause greater than itself, protect the
people and places in which it operates and generate more resources so that it can continue doing all those things for as
long as possible.

### ✅ A Just Cause Based Capitalism

Adam Smith proposed a just cause based capitalism:

- Consumption is the sole purpose of producer
- The "invisible-hand" ultimately gets customer the best product

### ❌ An Abused Capitalism

- Proposed by Nobel Prize winner Friedman
- The few people who control mega resources and abuse the system for personal gain is the sole purpose of producer
- Short-term finite-game mindset is then promoted throughout
- More severely, that leads to the many of the mistreatment of customers and employees to become normalized
