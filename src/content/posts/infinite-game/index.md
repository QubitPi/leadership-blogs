Ardeth Bay - My Role Model of A True Leader
-------------------------------------------

The cover image of my leadership blog is __Ardeth Bay__, a Medjai chieftain and warrior in a movie I watched few years
back - [_The Mummy Returns_](http://j.mp/1uwn500).

Being the descendent of royal Egyptian secret bodyguards also knows as _the Medjai_, Ardeth is the leader of 12 Medjai
tribes that together control tens of thousands of warriors. For over 3000 years, Ardeth along with his Medjai worriors
in desert performs the duty of safeguarding the eternal confinement which prevents the ancient evil supernatural powers
from releasing to this world. 

What captures me most subconsciously about Ardeth was a movie scene where Ardeth laid sat on one of the half-broken bus
chairs for a break after a dangerous yet successful battle with Rick O'Connell's family against 4 enemy mummies on a
double-deck British bus when Rick asked if he's alright, he smiled genuinely and replied:

:::note[Ardeth]

_"This was my first bus-ride"_. (see the clip below)

There are lots of "fake" leaders who enjoys the countless power and wealth and yet there is a true leader who at his
adult age never had the experience of boarding a regular bus. While those fake leaders always shot for short-term gains
for their personal wealth, Ardeth throughout the entire movie is focusing something bigger beyond himself - serving for
his people, his faith, and his value. Wealth, power, or all those luxury lifestyles are meaningless to him. What
distinguish Ardeth from other "leaders" is that Ardeth is truely an earch-touching leader with an
[__infinite-game mindset__](#the-infinite-game1).

There is no "end" for a leader. A leader is not someone who sits at the top enjoying champaign in a glorious golden
house, but instead like Ardeth who hold his position, his integrity, and his faith somewhere in a place where he
belongs, where he is fulfilling the oath of his ancestors' duties, and where he someday shall pass this glorious
responsibility to his next generations and all the way to the _infinite_ future.

The Infinite Game[^1]
---------------------

![](./the-infinite-game.png)

Large groups of people, united in common cause, chose to collaborate with no clear end in sight because we felt like we
were contributing to something bigger than ourselves, something with value that would last well beyond our own lifetimes

It is well within our power to build a world in which the vast majority of us wake up every single morning inspired,
feel safe at work and return home fulfilled at the end of the day

Great leaders are the ones who think beyond "short term" versus "long term." They are the ones who know that it is not
about the next quarter or the next election; it is about the next generation.

When we lead with a finite mindset in an infinite game, it leads to all kinds of problems, the most common of which
include the decline of trust, cooperation and innovation. Leading with an infinite mindset in an infinite game, in
contrast, really does move us in a better direction. Groups that adopt an infinite mindset enjoy vastly higher levels of
trust, cooperation and innovation and all the subsequent benefits.

### Just Cause

Facing competition, we keep being ourselves. Fighting to "win" v.s. Fighting for lives and values

A Just Cause is:

- for something

  - affirmative (not against something) and optimistic
  - inspiring

- Inclusive: serves as an invitation to join others in advancing a cause bigger than ourselves. A clear Cause is what ignites our passions. Infinite-minded leaders actively seek out employees, customers and investors who share a passion for the Just Cause.
- Service oriented - for the primary benefit of others, not company
- Resilient - independent of any physical produce or services
- Idealistic - no matter how much we have achieved, we always feel we have further to go.

### The Responsibility of A Business

The responsibility of business is to use its will and resources to advance a cause greater than itself, protect the
people and places in which it operates and generate more resources so that it can continue doing all those things for as
long as possible.

### ✅ A Just Cause Based Capitalism

Adam Smith proposed a just cause based capitalism:

- Consumption is the sole purpose of producer
- The "invisible-hand" ultimately gets customer the best product

### ❌ An Abused Capitalism

- Proposed by Nobel Prize winner Friedman
- The few people who control mega resources and abuse the system for personal gain is the sole purpose of producer
- Short-term finite-game mindset is then promoted throughout
- More severely, that leads to the many of the mistreatment of customers and employees to become normalized

### Ethical Fading

:::tip[Ethical Fading]

Ethical fading is a condition in a culture that allows people to act in unethical ways in order to advance their own 
interests, often at the expense of others, while falsely believing that they have not compromised their own moral 
principles.

:::

Ethical fading often starts with small, seemingly innocuous transgressions that, when left unchecked, continue to grow 
and compound.

Due to the financial performance pressure, organizations bend rules and incentivize/pressurize employees for meeting the
goals without consideration of the manner in which they met their goals. This sends a message to everyone else in the 
organization that making the numbers is more important than acting ethically. Employees, who might have family to feed 
or pressures from all kinds of aspects of their lives, tend to rationalize such misbehaviors and, in the long run, the 
snow ball grows to an organizational-wide extreme case, such as Wells Fargo whose thousands of employees engaged 
deceptive activities against their customers.

#### When Structure Replaces Leadership

:::tip[Lazy Leadership]

A new __process__ that was implemented as a solution when problem (performance lags, mistakes are made or unethical 
decisions are uncovered) arises in company, rather than the people are supported by diligent leadership. This kind of
solution is called __Lazy Leadership__

:::

An example of _process_ is to ask employee to fill timesheet so that company can keep track of how much salary-hours
they worked. It's easier to trust a process than to trust people. When leaders use process to replace judgment, they
create conditions favorable to ethical fading, because people can play with the process system to generate 
"false-positive" report, such as a mis-filled timesheet.

It should be noted that _process_ is great for managing a supply chain. Procedure helps improve manufacturing 
efficiencies. Ethical fading, however, is a people problem.

__The best antidote against ethical fading is an infinite mindset__. Leaders who give their people a
[Just Cause](#just-cause) to advance and give them an opportunity to work with a Trusting Team to advance it will build 
a culture in which their people can work toward the short-term goals while also considering the morality, ethics and 
wider impact of the decisions they make to meet those goals.
